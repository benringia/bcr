/*
 * CSS METHODOLOGY
 *
 * Organize project files that can better deal with CSS specifics like global namespace, cascade and selectors specificity.
 * Shares the same methodology of some popular methodologies like ITCSS, BEM, SMACSS and OOCSS.
 * This approach is to ensure everyone who participates in the development of a website works with a single codebase and speaks the same language.
 *
 * # Separated CSS codebase
 * Separate CSS codebase to several sections, this helps organized project files that can better deal with CSS specifics like global namespace, cascade and selectors specificity.
 *
 * 1. setting.css - contains custom properties (css variables), font-face, etc.
 * 2. base.css - reset and/or normalize styles, box-sizing definition, etc.
 * 3. layout.css - specific UI layouts.
 * 4. component.css - specific UI components.
 * 5. utitity.css - utilities and helper classes with ability to override anything.
 *
 *
 * # Naming convention
 * Highly useful, powerful, and simple naming convention that makes your front-end code easier to read and understand,
 * easier to work with, easier to scale, more robust and explicit, and a lot more strict.
 *
 * 1. prefix - (u) utility, (l) layout, (c) component, and (js) javascript related classes.
 * 2. classname - preferred class/object name.
 * 3. modifier - preferred modifier name.
 * 4. viewport - (sm) small, (md) medium, (lg) large, (xl) extra large.
 * 5. int - integer (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9).
 * 6. others - min, max, auto.
